# Ethernaut

Ethernaut is a set of solidity security challenges designed by OpenZeppelin. The problems are the .sol files beginning with "__[name of challenge].sol" and the solutions are in either "[name of challenge]Sol.html" or "[name of challenge]Sol.sol depenpding on whether my exploited used the Web3.js library or another smart contract

If I felt it was warranted, the problem also included a writeup.txt to explain the solution to the problem. This is especially the case if I thought the solution would not always work with different versions of solidity.
