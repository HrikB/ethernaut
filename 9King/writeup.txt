The trick to this problem is the fact that the king state variable is updated AFTER a transfer statement without adequate handling of what happens if the transfer event fails. So what we want to make sure is that the transfer event never succeeds.

The easiest way to do that would be to make a smart contract the king where the smart contract is missing both the receive() and fallback() function making the payment reject. This will break the game and no longer allow a change of kingship.
